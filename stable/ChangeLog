PHOEBE Project ChangeLog:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2006-06-11: - Upon request of Petr Harmanec, 3rd light can now be entered
              in percents of total light instead of internal flux units.
              This required a slight modification of the GUI appearence,
              namely the Luminosities tab: the "Edit 3rd light" button has
              been reduced in size and two radio buttons have been added
              with the 3rd light units' choice: percents or flux. In
              adition, several other functions needed to be changed and
              currently a slight confusion exists between light and lumi-
              nosity. The Luminosities tab clist *always* contains the
              values in units that the user has set: percents or fluxes.
              The DC fitting clist *always* contains the values in fluxes,
              since these are native to WD. Finally, the DC Luminosities
              clist *always* contains the values in luminosity, for 3rd
              light this effectively means that its value is multiplied by
              4\pi and that isotropic 3rd source is assumed. I hope this
              is not too complicated and I will think how to facilitate it
              in future. Note however that these design decisions will hit
              only the new version (0.30), this one will not be modified.
2006-06-06: - New WD (2005 version) binaries have replaced the older 2004
              version. The arrays have been resized to encompass 9000 data
              points and up to 60 surface elements.
2006-05-20: - Fotel import function set the 3rd column to be standard
              deviation, but it should be set to weight. Fixed.
2006-05-19: - The dereddening function did not properly remove interstellar
              extinction: DC iterations were not fed with de-reddened data
              and thus both the levels and temperature dependence on pass-
              band reddening were wrong. Fixed.
2006-05-17: - Independent fit variable (HJD or phase) in the Fitting tab
              was not properly parsed when opening parameter files, it was
              always set to Times. Many thanks to Petr Harmanec for pointing
              this out!
2006-03-16: - An OB1 error caused the last data point in both LC and RV data
              to be discarded. Fixed.
            - Slightly improved readout of LCO files now avoids problems
              when reading the value of masses/radii of both components.
2006-03-15: - Luminosities added to the LC plotting window upon feature
              request by Kresimir Pavlovski.
2006-02-03: - States of adjustment buttons and step values for spot para-
              meters were not saved and/or read out from .phoebe files.
              Fixed. Many thanks to Carla Maceroni for pointing this out!
2006-02-01: - RV plotting failed when a single RV data curve is defined
              because by default the plot is set for *both* RV curves.
              This is understandable, but the notice message indicated that
              there is a problem with data filename formatting. Fixed.
              Many thanks to Ettore Tamajo for pointing this out!
2006-01-31: - DC fitting quickbar did not mark the 2nd spot latitude and
              longitude due to a missing signal handler. Fixed. Many thanks
              to Carla Maceroni for pointing this out!
            - Further code cleaning done in the Spots section: the marked
              adjustment toggles remained active even if the spot was
              removed. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the Quickbar toggles
              was not tied to the spot number. These problems caused
              segfaults if the user was not pedantic enough to turn the
              switches off himself. Fixed.
            - An erroneous memory handling was present in DC window that
              caused arbitrary values of parameters to appear in different
              clist entries. Fixed.
            - PHOEBE 0.29a released! (a bugfix release)
2006-01-26: - PHOEBE segfaulted on some architectures if ^M characters were
              used (DOS/Windows <CR> character). These characters are now
              automatically removed during parsing.
2006-01-24: - Carla Maceroni pointed out obsolete tool-tips and labels that
              contained a reference to WD98 and were thus confusing the user
              about the WD version, which is the latest 2004 version. Fixed.
              Would you believe it: there were more than 15 instances of
              such obsolete labels! :( Sorry for the inconvenience!
            - Filters R and I of the Bessell series are actually Rc and Ic.
              Because of the missing 'c' the filters were not recognized
              as valid. Many thanks to Carla Maceroni for pointing this out!
            - PHOEBE segfaulted if invoked with -s and without the script
              file. Fixed.
            - A small memory leak in data allocation fixed.
2006-01-16: - CVS server moved to dioniz.fiz.uni-lj.si. README file updated.
2006-01-13: - PHOEBE reported to compile and run cleanly on Fedora Core 4.
              Many thanks to Carla Maceroni for pointing this out!
            - Empty lines in data files caused a spurious message about a
              malformatted input file. Fixed. The input files may now
              contain any number of white-space separated lines.
            - PHOEBE 0.29 released!
2006-01-06: - If two spots were adjusted simultaneously, parameter values
              were updated to erroneous fields (the last occurence of the
              spot parameter was updated to *all* spot fields). Fixed.
              Many thanks to Ron Kaitchuck for pointing this out!
            - The constraints of the overcontact binary not in thermal
              contact did not correspond to the WD set of constraints; in
              particular, A2, g2, x2 and y2 should not have been
              constrained, but they were nevertheless. Fixed. Many thanks
              to Ron Kaitchuck for pointing this out!
2006-01-03: - Stale debugging printout was removed from the terminal.
2005-12-31: - Well, I got two bug reports today, do you expect me to stand
              still and do nothing about it? Don't worry, the party begins
              at 18h and I won't be late! :)
            - The double-contact morphology constraint turned the adjustment
              switches for T2, A2 and GR2 on accidentally. Fixed.
            - MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!
2005-11-17: - Gravity brightening renamed to gravity darkening.
2005-11-11: - Observations for negative values of dP/dt were not phased
              properly for LC plots. Fixed.
2005-11-10: - A value button that set the number of spots on a secondary
              star was inadvertantly removed, which caused additional
              GTK+ warnings to be printed to the console. Fixed.
            - Dirk Terrell found a serious formatting bug in PHOEBE that
              caused malformed values of gravity darkening coefficients to
              be passed to WD. Fixed.
            - PHOEBE 0.28a released!
2005-11-01: - Critical epochs fully implemented. The program now computes
              the periastron passage phase, phases of superior and inferior
              conjunctions (the positions of minima) and phases of the
              ascending and descending nodes (the positions of maxima).
              This was incorporated on suggestion by Petr Harmanec.
            - Surface tab was a bit overcrowded due to the overwhelming
              space devoted to spots. Fixed.
            - PHOEBE 0.28 released!
2005-10-20: - Warning message for the invalid filter passband lacked a
              newline in the end of the line. Fixed.
2005-10-18: - Upper limit for the semi-major axis changed from 1000.0 to
              100000.0 RSun.
2005-10-15: - Labels "Experimental light curve" and "Experimental RV curve"
              changed to "Observed light curve" and "Observed RV curve" in
              plotting windows. The same has been done for all error-repor-
              ting windows.
2005-09-02: - Limb darkening coefficient interpolation didn't work for nega-
              tive values of metallicities due to a silly if-clause that
              rejected any parameters smaller than 0.0. Fixed. Many thanks
              to Janusz Kaluzny for pointing this out!
2005-08-30: - Constraints set for a double-contact binary were too strict:
              T2, A2 and GR2 can in fact be different from their primary
              star counterparts. Fixed.
2005-05-30: - Computing residuals in both LC and RV windows was done before
              aliasing took place, which meant that the residuals were com-
	      puted against the original (i.e. non-aliased) data. This in
	      turn meant that the phases were out-of-sync between aliased
	      data and residuals. This is now fixed. Many thanks to Keivan
	      Stassun for pointing this out!
            - A typo 'Vertexes' corrected to 'Vertices' in LC and RV plot
	      windows.
	    - PHOEBE 0.27 released!
2005-04-30: - PHOEBE installed without issues under Mandrake 9.1. Many
              thanks to Keith Bambery for reporting this!
2005-04-23: - A check added for C and Fortran compilers to configure.in.
              If they're not found, the configure script will exit with a
	      notification message. This was a major support hurdle, so it
	      should now help resolve common installation problems more
	      easily.
	    - A check added for netpbm package that contains ppmtoxpm tool
	      to configure.in. It was common to be able to compile and
	      run PHOEBE, but the plotting window wasn't able to convert
	      plots to xpm and hence there were no plots shown on screen.
	    - If SuperMongo isn't installed, the option to use it should
	      be shaded. The same goes for gnuplot. Fixed.
2005-04-18: - If physical parameters (T, M, log g) for LD tables were out-
              of-range, PHOEBE segfaulted. A range check is now added which
	      sets all LD coefficients to 0.5 if the overflow occurs.
            - Synchronicity parameters F1 and F2 were limited to the [0,1]
	      interval, which doesn't make sense if the stars are rotating
	      faster about their axis than is their period. It has now been
	      set to 10.
2005-04-14: - A new dedicated function added that renumbers all filters that
              share the same name. FOTEL parser suffered from this issue and
	      it now works in all cases where the 21st column of the FOTEL
	      input file is missing and all weights are in place. Some day
	      these two restrictions should be removed, but I don't think
	      it's such a problem to slightly modify the input.
2005-04-13: - GUI modified to encompass automatic LD interpolation! Testing
              was successful! :)
            - A big chunk of code added that is capable of parsing FOTEL
	      input data files. It should be reasonably fool-proof. This
	      was done after suggestion of Petr Harmanec. Note however that
	      any export (if someone desires it) will be left for contri-
	      bution of interested parties.
2005-04-12: - Another formatting problem in WD2004 has been discovered that
              caused improper readout of inclinations larger than 100 degs.
	      Many thanks to Petr Zasche for pointing this out!
            - Small (not really relevant) code cleaning was done.
            - During my visit in Prague, Petr Harmanec suggested that the
              LD coefficients should be dynamically interpolated whenever
              fitting is initiated. This is now implemented and tested. The
	      switch should still be incorporated in the GUI, but I don't
	      have glade installed and I'm away from the internet at the
              moment, so I'll be adding a button tomorrow.
2005-04-04: - IBAND was left unassigned if synthetic RV curve was plotted
              without any data files assigned, which caused ill-formatted
	      WD input file and hence a failed plot. Fixed.
2005-03-31: - Pixmaps were by default expected in /tmp instead of whatever
              directory user set to be the temporary directory. Fixed.
2005-02-14: - If *all* individual weights in a data file were equal (e.g.
              set to 1.0) and the type of weighting was set to Absolute
              error, conversion to weights failed because of division-by-
              zero error. The transformation function now checks whether
              min and max values of individual weights are the same and if
              they are, all weights are set to 1.0.
2005-01-28: - Several PHOEBE window types were set to Dialog instead of
              Top-level. This caused unsatisfactory behavior when windows
              were overlapping: dialog windows are always kept on top of the
              top-level windows. This shows when new gtk+1.2 libraries are
              used, i.e. Debian Testing. Fixed.
            - Default fonts on newer systems are substantially larger than
              the ones used before. That's why PHOEBE appearence is really
              bad on those systems. The crucial one on the Data tab is MZERO
              setting, which is fixed and should be ok for both old and new
              systems. Others will be fixed after the query on phoebe-discuss
              mailing list.
2005-01-24: - Added a stress to the top-level README file that SuperMongo
              depends on the netpbm package to convert between different
              image formats and that the user should have it installed.
2004-12-02: - If keyword files contained empty lines, PHOEBE messed up the
              readout, including if the empty line was at the end of file,
              because it somehow managed to overwrite strings. Now the
              string length checkup is done to see whether parsing should
              even be attempted or not. In other words, empty lines are now
              legitimate.
            - Radii of overcontact binaries are always ill-formatted due to
              incalculable derivatives for r_point. The readout from lco
              files is now value-by-value, so that all properly calculated
              radii are still printed out in the Plotting window.
            - The above-mentioned fix along with the formerly fixed bug that
              was reporting nonsense numbers for the radii in LC Plotting
              window is now applied to the RV Plotting window as well.
            - If the values for the radii aren't read out properly, the
              number outputted becomes "n/a" instead of -1.0.
2004-11-15: - Comparison against uninitialized strings in readout functions
              has been fixed. This didn't influence the way PHOEBE was run-
              ning, it's just tidier now.
            - Bugfix: if the user used binning on a file with time as inde-
              pendent variable but phase was selected (or if phases in a
              file weren't on the [-0.5, 0.5] interval, PHOEBE segfaulted.
              These values are now simply discarded.
            - Temperature range limits were too strict - lower limit has
              been reduced from 3500K to 500K and upper limit was increased
              from 50000K to 100000K.
2004-11-01: - PHOEBE has been precompiled and packaged under Debian stable
              (Woody). The deb package is at your disposal on PHOEBE's
              homepage. The debian/ top-level directory was added to the
              development source, but it won't be submitted to the CVS.
2004-10-29: - PHOEBE crashed when LC was plotted, but the filter wasn't de-
              fined (i.e. set LCNO to 1 and plot the LC as is). The assumed
              values for bandpass-dependent variables are now defaults.
2004-10-28: - If .lco file readout fails on lines giving radii, uninitialized
              values were used in LC Plotting window. Now these values are
              initialized to -1.0 (so that the problem is obvious). Due to
              this bug PHOEBE was reported to crash. Thanks to Ethem Derman
              for pointing this out!
2004-10-21: - Array sizes in WD have been changed to accomodate for Nmax=60
              and 6000 observation points.
            - PHOEBE 0.26 released!
2004-10-12: - The underlaying WD version changed to 2004-09-17, which fixes
              a bug mentioned below. Things should now work well. After some
              testing, a new PHOEBE version will be released.
2004-09-06: - All tabs in phoebe_fortran_routines.f replaced with two spaces.
              This removes the inconsistency with some older FORTRAN compilers.
            - PHOEBE functions for creating LCI and DCI files updated to con-
              form to the new layout of WD version 2004-06-09.
            - A bug in lco data readout fixed. The values are now again repor-
              ted properly.
            - PHOEBE now works with the newest WD version. There is still a
              persistent bug present in WD that returns NANs for symmetrical
              derivatives. 0.26 will thus be postponed until this issue is
              resolved.
2004-07-24: - Simplex values (step size, min & max values) for log g and [M/H]
              were completely off. Since they were disabled anyway, this
              doesn't influence PHOEBE at all, but when converting keyword
              files from 0.2x to 0.3x versions, mayhem happens. Fixed.
2004-07-23: - After a successful CVS restauration, a new release is in order:
              PHOEBE 0.25 testing release is out!
2004-06-29: - A fitting quickbar typo (Origin of time -> Argument of peri-
              astron) fixed. Thanks to Dirk Terrell for pointing this out!
2004-05-28: - PHOEBE successfully compiled under Fedora Core 2. Thanks to
              Dirk Terrell for reporting this!
2004-05-26: - Independent variable selection wasn't saved to the keyword
              file, it is now fixed. Also, HJD is now adopted instead of
              phase as the default choice.
2004-05-21: - Re-arranged the HJD->phase formula in phoebe_transformations.c
              to avoid precision problems.
2004-05-08: - The tooltip text of the Base PHOEBE directory in the Configu-
              ration window was misleading; fixed. Many thanks to Carla
              Maceroni for pointing this out!
            - PHOEBE compiles and installs under Gentoo Linux without is-
              sues. Many thanks to Mike Sallman for pointing this out!
2004-05-03: - Top-level README file updated.
            - PHOEBE-0.24 released.
            - PHOEBE 0.24 reported to install and run without issues under
              Linux SuSE 9.0. Many thanks to Jan Skalicky for pointing this
              out!
2004-04-26: - Stale WD98 label from the Configuration window removed.
            - Top-level README file updated for the upcoming 0.24 version.
              Other top-level files slightly updated.
            - Top-level AUTHORS updated with Dirk's affiliation.
2004-04-25: - Plot limits for 3D stellar plots increased to +/- 1.3a rather
              than +/- 1a, since a noticeable fraction of all plots went
              out of plot bounds. The plot is a bit smaller now, but it
              shouldn't be too inconvenient. 0.3x version will handle this
              properly. The limits are changed for both SM and GnuPlot.
            - configure.in updated with the plotting package test: if both
              SuperMongo and GnuPlot are missing, configure script stops
              and requests from the user to install either of the packages.
              Again, 0.3x version will remove this constraint so that the
              user will be able to compile only the scripter, but for 0.2x
              versions this isn't possible.
2004-04-23: - Added support for Portable Network Graphics (png) when using
              GNUPlot package.
            - Support for different devices added to Plot-to-File window.
              The devices are now initialized through a create_plot_to_file_
              drop_down_menu () function in phoebe_gui_accessories.c. This
              function is called at initialization time and every time the
              configuration is permanently or temporarily changed.
            - PHOEBE About window expanded to include all authors along with
              their e-mails and specific work done in PHOEBE.
            - Added support for additional filters when using the
              Van Hamme limb darkening tables (Stroemgrem u and y, Johnson
              K L M N, and Cousins Rc and Ic)
            - Next PHOEBE version release 0.24 planned for 1st May.
2004-04-22: - GNUPlot checkup now used in plotting functions.
            - Added workaround lines in phoebe_allocations.c, functions
              read_in_synthetic_lc_data () and read_in_synthetic_rv_data ()
              to assure correct synthetic data parsing output.
            - GNUPlot 3d plot now enlarged to use all canvas space.
            - The implementation of spot fitting didn't support updating the
              calculated values to the main PHOEBE window. The fix is rele-
              ased to the phoebe-dev CVS. Thanks to Dirk Terrell for poin-
              ting this out!
            - Third light values didn't get updated from the fitting window
              due to a silly OB1 bug. Fixed.
            - A new switch introduced to the Luminosities tab that couples
              or decouples log g1 and log g2 values of the model and of the
              atmospheres. By default this switch couples both values. It
              has been added to the keyword files with MODELLGG_ON keyword.
            - The string of the titlebar of PHOEBE main window changed during
              startup. 'BinariEs' -> 'Binaries'. Now it stays 'BinariEs'.
            - CVS write access granted to Dirk Terrell. Welcome aboard,
              Dirk! :)
2004-04-21: - Top-level configure.in hard dependency on SuperMongo finally
              dropped. PHOEBE should now compile without it! :)
            - src/Makefile.am updated to allow compiling without SM libra-
              ries. Two conditionals govern the library inclusions.
            - All SuperMongo-related functions #ifdef'ed to SM presence for
              compiling.
            - Radio button default in the configuration window changed to
              gnuplot.
            - GNUPlot checkup added to configure.in. If it is found,
              PHOEBE_GNUPLOT_SUPPORT is defined in config.h. All GnuPlot
              functions should thus check for this switch with #ifdef and
              #endif clauses.
            - CVS write access granted to Michael Bauer. Welcome aboard,
              Mike! :)
            - When updating true double-precision parameters such as HJD0,
              PERIOD, DPDT and DPERDT from the fitting window to the main
              window, the exponential form wasn't accurate enough and the
              fit, although numerically correct, was useless. This is now
              fixed. Thanks to Dirk Terrell for pointing this out!
2004-04-20: - Main CVS PHOEBE branch finally (and fully) supports GNUPlot!
              Many thanks to Michael Bauer for the complete implementation.
              The gnuplot support is in testing, but should reach stable
              in a couple of days! This means you can expect the new stable
              version soon! :)
            - PHOEBE GUI hooks for plotting packages implemented and tested.
              Plugging in new plotting packages is now as easy as writting
              a single package-dedicated function with specified list of
              arguments. So, if you want to see your favorite package sup-
              ported in PHOEBE, please consider contributing! :)
            - Error and exception handling wrappers downported from 0.30
              version. They are in phoebe_error_handling.c.
2004-04-16: - Added debugging support to stable PHOEBE version. To compile
              PHOEBE with debugging enabled, use --enable-debug switch in
              ./configure script.
            - IBAND value was undefined if synthetic LC was plotted without
              any filter selected. It now falls back to the default value,
              550nm Johnson V filter.
2004-04-15: - Different locales had different decimal digit symbol conven-
              tion. In example, German locale uses ',' instead of '.', which
              caused PHOEBE to crash. Now the locale is changed to "C" in-
              ternally and restored to the previous state upon exit. Please
              report any problems, since it's difficult to test all locales.
              This approach makes certain that the data/keyword file compa-
              tibility persists over all platforms.
2004-04-14: - Default RV vertices number was set to 10. It has now been in-
              creased to 100.
            - The UVLeo.phoebe file wasn't conforming to distributed experi-
              mental data files. Many thanks to Michael Bauer for pointing
              this out!
            - Files atmcof.dat and atmcofplanck.dat were installed as execu-
              tables rather than data files. This had no consequence for
              usage, but it is more elegant this way.
            - If the string was the last inputted value in a particular
              keyword file, its last character was still truncated. Fixed.
              Please check your old keyword files for this bug.
            - PHOEBE 0.23 released.
            - PHOEBE CVS updated to 0.23 version. This made 0.1x through
              0.20 versions obsolete (using WD98). Please use 0.21 or higher
              for your work.
2004-01-19: - Mode logic made simplex border widgets sensitive, which
              shouldn't be. Fixed.
            - When changing mode logic, toggle buttons weren't checked if
              they were turned on. If they were, now they are turned off.
              Program logic already handled that correctly, but it was con-
              fusing for users.
            - A small bug that left some labels unsensitive while changing
              mode logic has been fixed.
            - A readout string that is used to read out widget data was
              allocated, which mustn't be according to GTK+ standards. This
              created spurious entries in keyword files (missing parts of
              strings, incomplete words, wrongly interpreted whitespaces...)
2003-12-17: - Hardcoded /tmp directory name for chi2 plotting changed to the
              proper temporary directory set in Settings->Configuration.
            - Symbolic linking to atmcof.dat and atmcofplanck.dat from the
              working (temporary) directory incorporated. Thus copying the
              two files isn't necessary anymore. However, this potentially
              reduces portability due to symlink () function usage. In the
              next PHOEBE version this will be handled differently.
            - Old e-mail changed with the new one in toplevel AUTHORS.
            - PHOEBE 0.21 released.
2003-12-16: - Administrative work for the new release finished. 0.21 will
              soon be released.
2003-09-18: - Some WD-related limitations set on spot parameter switches
              and a bug in PHOEBE removed (wrong KSP* setting).
            - Secondary spot values carried " signs, which were removed.
2003-09-16: - PHOEBE adopted WD 2003 version as the main back-bone. All
              functions changed and updated accordingly.
2003-06-10: - There was a problem in changing parameter values of the type
              string - the spaces weren't parsed correctly. Fixed.
            - Two generic scripts - one for detached binaries and the other
              for overcontact binaries - added to the scripts/ directory.
              The whole directory put under the CVS. The install script will
              install this directory to /usr/local/share/phoebe/scripts.
2003-06-09: - Normalizing magnitude parameter (MNORM) in Data tab had way
              too many decimals. From 5 it is now reduced to 1.
            - A script function Estimate Normalizing Magnitude () added to
              the scripter. It doesn't take any arguments. It calculates the
              median of all LC input files and returns the average.
            - If a keyword file was opened from within a script, the speci-
              cations info list didn't get updated. Fixed.
2003-06-08: - Due to the opening of the default keyword file at startup, the
              main window title got erased. Fixed.
            - Finding tokens with strtok () function modified the initial
              pointer, thus changing the contents of the Scripter window.
              By copying the contents of the original parameter string to
              a temporary token string, this problem is circumvented.
            - A small bug in startup line parsing called OpenKeywordFile
              function on a script if the script name was the last parameter
              in the command line. This was annoying because if scripts were
              called from the command line, a notice window popped up, comp-
              laining that the keyword file is a legacy file. Fixed.
2003-06-07: - Keywords LC_INDEP, LC_DEP, RV_INDEP and RV_DEP accidentally
              left out from keyword files. Fixed.
            - A new scripter command added: Adjust Parameters. The argument
              may be composed of many PHOEBE keywords separated by a comma.
              This means that PHOEBE may be used for something useful from
              a script - while it's working, you may actually get a cup of
              coffee! :)
2003-06-05: - Further work on PHOEBE tutorial has been done. First 18 pages
              are up-to-date for 0.20 version and basically ready to print.
2003-06-04: - Plot LC to File and Plot RV to File scripter commands lacked
              the filter name argument. Fixed.
            - Entry contents are now flushed each time the scripter command
              is changed. It just didn't look useful to preserve it.
            - Top-level SPECS file updated to contain instructions on adding
              PHOEBE keywords and scripter commands to PHOEBE.
            - A new keyword, LC_FILTER, added to PHOEBE.
            - Argument parsing is now done with strtok () function, which
              simplified this routine enormously. Why didn't I think of this
              before?
            - PHOEBE keywords RV_PLOT_SYNTHETIC, RV_PLOT_EXPERIMENTAL and
              RV_FILTER added to PHOEBE.
            - defaults/default.phoebe updated to the new format. PHOEBE now
              calls this file during startup, so changing this file changes
              startup values permanently.
            - UV Leonis photometric images are in fact acquired with Bessell
              filter set, not Johnson. Headers of both files have been fixed
              accordingly. Small headers added to RV data.
            - A heavy fixup has been done on the PHOEBE tutorial.
            - Bessell filter set incorporated in filter drop-down list.
            - A typo in Component-Related (capital R) tab label fixed.
2003-06-03: - Scripter backbone has been completely rewritten. The commands
              are now declared only on one place and from there they are
              added to the GUI. To extend the command list, one simply has
              to add a proper definition of the command. This makes room
              for user-generated scripter commands (also loops and run-time
              controls).
2003-05-29: - CLA adjust button state wasn't saved to the keyword file. It
              is now fixed, but only for the new keyword file format.
            - New keyword files are now fully parsed. Everything is now the
              same as before, only much simpler and more efficient.
            - Notice window added to notify the user when legacy keyword
              files are opened.
            - Top-level README file changed to contain this information.
            - PHOEBE has been promoted from "testing" to "beta"! The next
              version will be 0.20!
            - Autoutils' "missing" script added to autoutils directory and
              to the CVS.
            - Author's e-mail updated in the About window.
2003-05-28: - Cleaning-up of scripter routines has been performed.
            - A MAJOR CHANGE: keyword file format has been changed. This was
              done to conform to ISO/BASH standards. The structure of this
              file is now: KEYWORD=VALUE for numbers and KEYWORD="STRING"
              (quoted) for strings. This enables proper readouts from
              scripts as well. The routine for backward compability will
              remain for a year, but it will issue a warning of format
              change with an option of automatic conversion.
            - Log g and Metallicity widget ranges added to keyword files.
            - Keyword files' handling heavily rewritten. Everything has been
              cleaned up, routines should run even quicker.
            - Implementation of keyword saving isn't yet complete, so the
              CVS won't be updated.
2003-05-26: - Two new keywords added: LC_PLOT_SYNTHETIC and LC_PLOT_EXPERI-
              MENTAL. These two are booleans that govern the state of LC
              plotting window toggle buttons. They may be changed like any
              other widget value, where the argument has to be TRUE or
              FALSE.
            - Boolean type recognition in script wrappers implemented.
            - A script warning wrapper implemented. If a script calls a
              macro that isn't recognized, PHOEBE will complain about it,
              but will skip it and try to complete the script.
2003-05-24: - Change Parameter Value scripting function fully implemented
              and working flawlessly.
2003-05-23: - Change Parameter Value (keyword, value) added to scripting.
              The prototypes are fully implemented, but the actual script
              function still remains to be written, since the next step is
              to automate the change through PHOEBE keywords.
2003-05-21: - Working with global keywords furtherly simplified the work
              with data sheets. Flushing all parameter values to the sheet
              is now done fully automatically, so the value gets appended
              simply by adding a new keyword to phoebe_global definition.
              Printing out relevant parameters is still governed by hand,
              for obvious reasons.
            - Spectra number (keyword SPECNO) added to Open/Save keyword
              files.
2003-05-20: - Adding keywords to data sheet from scripts fully implemented.
              The user should use keywords listed in phoebe_global.h. There
              should be a table of these keywords with short descriptions
              in PHOEBE reference manual.
2003-05-15: - Gravity potential limitation values were too tight (their up-
              per limit being 20). It has now been increased to 1000.
            - Support for adding individual parameters to data sheet from
              within a script implemented. Parameter recognition still has
              to be properly implemented.
            - A lot of widget-naming cleaning up has been done. The inclina-
              tion keyword XINCL permanently changed to INCL.
            - A new global enum created that holds all PHOEBE keywords. The-
              se keywords have unique corresponding widgets which are atta-
              ched in a single function in accessories. Thus if a widget na-
              me changes, the only change imposed is in that function.
2003-05-14: - More work on Data Sheet window has been done, but it's still
              not appropriate for everyday usage yet.
            - A prototyped support for adding entries to the Data Sheet from
              the scripter implemented. Routines first have to be cleaned
              before I connect them to their callbacks.
            - Saving keyword files now uses generic file selector widget,
              so the original widget is deleted. A signal clean-up function
              is introduced that makes sure all signals are removed when a
              user cancels any action in file selector window(s).
            - Data Sheet printing to files implemented. It is called through
              a wrapper function (everything_ok_with_the_filename), which
              isn't yet written, so use *real* filenames, otherwise PHOEBE
              will crash.
            - Data Sheet scripting implemented. Currently the user may flush
              the contents of relevant data sheet to the given file. One may
              not yet make custom data sheets. This is next to be done.
2003-05-12: - A script for saving files added and is fully functional.
            - A tester remnant which outputted spots' parameters to terminal
              has been deleted.
            - Data Sheet prototype function add_parameter_to_data_sheet_list
              has been implemented. It is called much like the keyword hand-
              lers.
            - First couple of entries already put to the Data Sheet window.
2003-05-08: - A new generic widget PHOEBE_file_selector created. This window
              has only "delete-event" callbacks attached to the kill button
              and to the cancel button. The rest has to be assigned within
              the calling routine along with the actual callback that per-
              forms the specific action. See "on_scripter_open_script_*" as
              an example.
            - Open and Save script buttons in Scripter are now fully func-
              tional. For fool-proofing a new routine has been added to
              phoebe_gui_accessories.c called everything_ok_with_the_
              _filename (char *filename). It is empty for now, but as it
              should perform generic tests, all openings/savings should be
              called only if this wrapper returns 1. This thus deserves my
              full attention for quite some time, so I'll be delving into
              this when I'm a bit less tired. ;)
2003-05-07: - Script name given in command line is now parsed and checked
              for existence; if it doesn't exist, PHOEBE will exit with the
              fatal signal.
            - Quitting PHOEBE from scripter now cleans after itself (all
              PHOEBE related /tmp files).
2003-04-26: - I'M MARRIED! :)
2003-04-22: - Keywords LC_VERTICES and RV_VERTICES added to the keyword fi-
              le. It works both for opening and saving keyword files.
            - Two new actions added to scripter for calculating gravity po-
              tentials. The calculated values are then inputed to their main
              PHOEBE window values.
2003-04-20: - Opening/Saving scripts algorithms written. GUI part is not fi-
              nished yet, but all read-in fool-proofing has been added. The
              user must be careful to write the proper action names, though.
            - A new option, "-s" or "--script", followed by the script name,
              added to PHOEBE command line. If one wants to execute a script
              named test.script, one would issue phoebe -s test.script (the
              script has to be in that directory, otherwise one must supply
              a path to it as well). There is no fool-proof support yet, I
              have to test it furtherly first.
2003-04-19: - Data sheet window created; it is empty for now, but all call-
              backs have been connected.
            - PHOEBE scripter completely rewritten. GUI-related stuff is
              completely implemented and fool-proofed, action-editing but-
              tons fully working. Four scripts already implemented: opening
              keyword files,  LC plotting, RV plotting and quitting. It
              should be stressed that the contents fool-proofing is up to
              the user at present, if something is wrong, scripter will ca-
              use a segfault.
            - Four new keywords added to keyword files readout: LC_INDEP,
              LC_DEP, RV_INDEP and RV_DEP. These are introduced to easily
              manipulate what the user wants from scripts - all it takes is
              to create a keyword file containing *only* the parameters the
              user wants changed and opening it from a script.
            - A new documentation file, keywords.gnumeric, created. It con-
              tains all keywords that PHOEBE recognizes with concise desc-
              ription and remarks. It may be readily exported to postscript.
2003-04-17: - Filling issue resolved; PHOEBE issued a warning every time the
              solution "spilt" over L1 or L2, although it should issue this
              warning only when L2 is exceeded. Thus a new function for cal-
              culating critical L1 and L2 potentials is introduced and a new
              callback is attached to all widgets that are relevant to these
              critical values (RM, F1/2, PHSV/PCSV and E). The LC/RV plot-
              ting windows are extended to contain these values together
              with the information on exceeded state. The warning on L2
              overfill is still kept in PHOEBE.
2003-04-16: - WD98 Notices temporarily disabled to sort out the L1/2 filling
              issue.
2003-04-09: - Fitting implementation for spots is now finished. However, up-
              dating still isn't done, since I first have to test the imple-
              mentation.
2003-04-07: - Further work has been done on spots. The GUI for adjusting
              spot parameters is finished and fitting callbacks provided.
              It still lacks the step values, but I'll get around to do it
              in a while. Fitting isn't yet fully implemented, this comes
              next, but not today. ;)
2003-04-03: - A new programming philosophy concerning memory allocation has
              been adopted: allocations and de-allocations of memory from
              now on *must* be performed within one function. If the func-
              tion would become bloated, *two* new functions may be intro-
              duced: allocate_memory_for_* and free_memory_allocated_for_*.
              Both of these newly created functions *must* be also called
              from within the same parent function. This way memory leaks
              shouldn't occur anymore. All error handling should also be
              performed in these supplementary functions.
            - Spots part completely rewritten to reflect the above philoso-
              phy. Multiple spots are now available (as opposed to only one
              spot situation acting until now) on both stars. All spots'
              parameters are now saved to and opened from keyword files.
            - Semi-detached binary with secondary star filling the Roche
              lobe wasn't constrained properly: both potentials were turned
              off. This was reported by Frederic Royer and is now fixed.
2003-03-26: - A small bug fixed which prevented both RV curves to be plotted
              simultaneously. It was introduced 30 minutes ago and is now
              fixed, so noone should really suffer from it.
2003-03-24: - There was a problem if WD98 reached an internal error (such
              as the temperature range being exceeded in ATM routine) before
              anything else: PHOEBE didn't check for successful allocation
              before trying to write out parameters into their frame and
              thus segfaulted when doing so. Fixed.
2003-03-21: - Data info table sorted out completely. It is now working pro-
              perly, but will remain in the Utilities tab as long as I don't
              decide where (and how) to put it permanently. Any suggestions
              are more than welcome.
2003-03-20: - Synthetic noise adding yielded yet another undocumented com-
              ment in WD98 output files, which caused PHOEBE to segfault.
              All readouts have now been changed to ignore all unexpected
              notices which occur before/after data. If they occur in the
              data itself, then something's very wrong and should be repor-
              ted/inspected.
            - Synthetic noise frame contents have been rearranged; the noise
              switch limited the Gaussian noise to scale only with the squa-
              re root of the light level, now the user may choose the weigh-
              ting as desired. Global switches struct was changed to make
              this possible.
            - GUI layout has been changed permanently. No major changes are
              expected to occur in three tabs: "System-related", "Component-
              related" and "Luminosities". Other tabs should be furtherly
              optimized.
            - Plotting routines have been cleaned of individual variables
              for seed and sigma in their declarations. Everything now goes
              through typedef'd structs.
            - A new configuration switch added to enable the user to disa-
              ble the warning on synthetic scatter applied to LCs.
            - The default SEED value changed to 1.5E8 instead of 1.0E8 to
              avoid underflowing the expected format in WD98 if a user for-
              gets to create its own seed.
            - A summary of important data on input data files, such as the
              number of points, the sum of all points, the median etc. will
              be given in a table that will get updated automatically. The
              prototype for it currently resides in the Utilities tab, but
              it will be moved to a separate window as soon as it is fini-
              shed.
            - The default directory for assigning data files changed to the
              data directory instead of the base directory, which appears
              more logical.
            - The default sigma value for input data files changed from 0
              to 0.1, because fitting failed if sigma was accidentaly left
              at 0.
            - First automatic file analysis routines have been implemented,
              but are far from stable. If you downloaded today's CVS, please
              update it as soon as possible again, because stability is
              really low right now. I hope to update the CVS once more to-
              night.
2003-03-14: - Further changes on GUI have been performed. It still isn't fi-
              nal, but very close to.
            - Double contact binaries have both Omegas constrained, but un-
              til now only Omega2 was constrained. Fixed.
2003-03-13: - A major change in PHOEBE tabs has been introduced; tabs Basic
              and Advanced didn't make much sense, really; they will be re-
              placed with new (similar) tabs, one of them will contain all
              physical parameters of a binary as a whole and the other will
              contain individual, star-specific parameters. I still haven't
              decided upon their names, but probably something like General
              and Individual. I have to consider other naming conventions,
              though. Anyway, a General tab has already been implemented and
              all callbacks now point to new widgets. Old ones have been
              erased, although tabs still pertain. The reason is that I want
              to make a permanent, thus optimal outlook and I'm experimen-
              ting what looks good and what doesn't. If you have any sugges-
              tions, please let me know.
            - Another configuration option is implemented: the user may
              choose whether PHOEBE should ask each time for overwriting
              confirmation on Save.
            - While I was at it, a confirmation on quitting is also added
              to the Configuration window.
            - PHOEBE's main window "delete-event" was connected to gtk_main
              quit instead to a wrapper. Fixed.
            - A segfaulting bug that appeared when invalid keyword filenames
              were chosen (e.g. directories, devices, ...) fixed.
2003-03-10: - Aliasing was poorly implemented and it didn't alias some data
              points properly (for all-positive phase intervals). It has now
              been completely rewritten (simplified) and fully tested.
            - A tiny bug in Clear button in LC plotting window tried to era-
              se a non-existent widget. This only caused a warning to be
              displayed in the terminal, but it is fixed now.
            - A temporary tab is introduced in the main window. It will
              replace the Basic tab eventually, when all input entries are
              accordingly update it. Please ignore it for now.
            - A serious problem was discovered and reported by Frederic Ro-
              yer: WD98 algorithm sometimes suppresses the calculation of
              synthetic curves because of internal problems, such as excee-
              ded temperature range and such. The notice windows are now
              added to inform the user such error has occured. There is no
              workaround for this problem, it has to be communicated to R.
              Wilson.
2003-03-06: - A new source file pair "phoebe_scripting.c.h" introduced; it
              will contain all scripting routines. These scripting routines
              must perform basic actions such as opening/closing/plotting/
              fitting/... with only one call with arbitrary arguments. This
              way the user will be able to write his own scripts.
2003-03-05: - Command line parsing implemented. Standard arguments -h and -v
              have been initialized (with their longer (--) counterparts).
              Parsing is done in phoebe_gui_accessories, but only to the ex-
              tent of writting to a global PHOEBE_args variable. This is
              then parsed furtherly in phoebe_init() function, after all re-
              levant variables have already been initialized. This goes es-
              pecially for keyword files given at input, which are now fully
              supported. Extending command-line options is simple. This
              means that PHOEBE will soon be able to run from batch scripts.
            - Filter management rewritten. Combo boxes are no longer used,
              because they got really crowded. Everything is now accessed
              through a button click and a pop-up menu bar with menues, sub-
              menues etc. Geneva filter system is now fully active.
2003-03-03: - CVS repository moved to /var/lib/cvs at Deneb; README file has
              been updated, PHOEBE homepage as well. Permissions have been
              tightened, although access is still available via :pserver:.
            - acconfig.h that is needed for make dist script was missing
              from Makefile.am. Fixed.
2003-03-01: - Plotting package directory removed from Configuration options
              since everything is now called through libraries and not exe-
              cutables.
            - Configuration file indentation changed by 1, to be aligned
              with the longest tag-name. This doesn't have any impact on
              the performance, it just looks better.
            - Configuration file keywords' readout has been fool-proofed.
              It should now be resistant to nonsense content.
            - Tooltip description for the defaults directory changed.
            - file_exists() function restricted detection only to those fi-
              les which the user had the full permission to handle (644),
              so the files in /usr/local/share/phoebe weren't properly tes-
              ted. Fixed.
            - A bug in configuration path assignment assigned a FF path to
              DC path, which caused wrong DC path *only* during the first-
              ever start of PHOEBE. Fixed.
            - When PHOEBE is installed, the working directory was set to
              the base directory, which is /usr/local/share/phoebe. Any user
              without root priviliges cannot write to that directory and
              that is why image generation failed. It is now fixed and fool-
              proofed (a notice window pops up if priviliges are missing).
            - Fool-proofing on directory names, priviliges and content has
              been implemented for Configuration options.
            - PHOEBE-0.15 released. It is substantially lighter that its
              precessors, because of the make dist rule which puts only the
              most relevant files into the distribution.
2003-02-27: - Location of pixmaps changed from share/pixmaps to pixmaps and
              it was merged with icons. This was done to furtherly clear up
              the root directory. All source files have been updated accor-
              dingly.
            - Base directory for installation changed to /usr/local/share.
              Within there will be a phoebe directory with slightly changed
              hierarchial structure as in the main distribution. All defa-
              ult values for .phoebe have been changed accordingly.
            - Install script is now in place. Makefile.am-s have been add-
              ed to all relevant subdirectories that should be installed:
              bin, include and pixmaps.
            - share/ directory renamed to defaults/ and it contains only
              defaults.phoebe file. It is used for restoring defaults in
              the main PHOEBE window. It has its Makefile.am.
            - Directory flux_files added to the main tree along with Make-
              file.am.
            - doc directory also added to the install script.
            - make install script works completely! There are still some
              small pixmaps' issues that need be resolved, but it's just
              a minor problem! Enjoy!
            - CVS server is currently unavailable due to maintenance. All
              changes will be commited after the server gets up and running
              again.
2003-02-24: - FEEDBACK file was outdated and was deleted from the distribu-
              tion.
            - File share/phoebe_init.sm deleted from the CVS, since it had
              no purpose. Same done with icons/under_construction.xpm, be-
              cause another instance of this pixmap was already in shared
              pixmaps directory.
            - Top-level Makefile.am finally adopted for automatic distribu-
              tion creation by issuing make dist in the top-level directo-
              ry. Install script has yet to be implemented properly.
            - Data files for UV Leonis have been updated (new RV curves).
2003-02-23: - Underdimensioning problem was present in weighting choices'
              names (defined 20, but contained all the way to 32 charac-
              ters), which caused PHOEBE to segfault if compiled with older
              compilers (gcc 2.95 or lower). All static dimensions have now
              been set to 255 to avoid any future problems of this kind.
            - 3rd light edit button had an incomplete label, since it con-
              tained opacity settings as well. It has been changed accor-
              dingly.
            - RV Plot Clear button referred to old (non-existent) widgets,
              which caused GTK-WARNINGs. Fixed.
2003-02-20: - Geneva photometric system added to filter list. This was requ-
              ested by Frederic Royer. Full implementation will be done af-
              ter defreezing PHOEBE.
2003-02-19: - PHOEBE development moved to Debian Linux (Woody 3.0r1). RedHat
              policy on new versions proved to be unstable and file locati-
              ons tend to change constantly.
            - README file updated, some minor changes in include directives
              have been made.
2003-02-10: - Finally RV plotting is completed. Plotting residuals now works
              for all different dependent variables, sigma is calculated for
              both curves as well. Hopefully nothing is left to implement at
              the time.
            - PHOEBE root directory got very cluttered, so all autoutils-re-
              lated utilities have been moved to the new autoconfig direc-
              tory.
            - GdkPixbuf library was used to put graphics on screen in gif
              format. This library was missing on some older systems and was
              thus abandoned for the time being in PHOEBE, because I believe
              in simplicity above all. All configure and make hooks have
              also been removed. Consequently there are no more installation
              issues related to this library's directory.
            - Configure script now checks for SuperMongo libraries. If they
              aren't found, configure script stops with an error.
2003-02-07: - Save and Save As buttons finally work as they are supposed to.
              If the filename isn't given (i.e. parameters inputted to de-
              fault startup screen), Save will prompt the user for filename,
              otherwise it will overwrite the current keyword file. On the
              other hand, Save As will always prompt for a filename and ask
              the user to confirm overwritting in case the chosen filename
              already exists. Save option has a shortcut CTRL+S. It would
              be beneficial to get feedback from users on which button is
              more useful in the button box: Save or Save As or maybe both.
            - Main PHOEBE window title now contains star name. A callback
              is connected to the Star Name entry field and whenever it is
              changed, the window title changes too. This is very useful to
              keep track if multiple PHOEBEs are open.
2003-02-06: - Input file parsing rewritten. Comments '#' are now completely
              supported: they may occur wherever and only the remainder of
              the line is discarded, everything else stays. Empty lines are
              also legal (as of now), arbitrary formatting is still preser-
              ved (use spaces or tabs).
            - Function parse_input_data introduced to accessories. This fun-
              ction is to be called whenever input file parsing is necessa-
              ry.
            - OB1 error in reporting data points number (1 too much) fixed.
2003-02-05: - PHOEBE goes into freeze state. This means that no new features
              are going to be implemented until the next release (0.15). In
              the next couple of weeks only code cleaning and bug fixing
              will be performed.
            - Code cleaning: obsolete PHOEBE_data definition was finally de-
              leted and new_PHOEBE_data was renamed to PHOEBE_data. This was
              a global change, so all source files are affected.
2003-02-04: - Configuration window has been improved. The main interface now
              contains tabs. Currently there are two tabs: Files and Options
              tab. Files tab holds whatever was there in the first place and
              Options tab contains (will contain) options. Right now there
              is only one option implemented: to plot or not to plot star
              images automatically when phase is changed. For slower compu-
              ters this seemed necessary to have, since it would take ages
              to compute the image every time. For faster computers this
              switch should of course be on.
            - Plot to File completely implemented and tested for star image
              plotting. Data for individual devices get rescaled because of
              aspect ratio problems in SuperMongo.
2003-02-03: - Star images are now fully supported. Everything works! Spots
              are displayed, all phases, there is a callback attached to the
              phase spin button that when it gets changed, the image is au-
              tomatically updated. Plot to File still isn't implemented and
              I am considering removing the Calculate button and exchanging
              it with Animate button. But this is long-term.
2003-01-24: - log g and metallicity for both stars added to main typedef.
              Their values are read in through the read_in_main_parameters
              function.
2003-01-23: - A median calculation routine has been implemented. Two new fi-
              les have been introduced: phoebe_calculations.c and .h. These
              hold all mathematical calculations performed in/by PHOEBE.
            - Simplex limits-to be are shaded out not to confuse new users.
            - Center-of-Mass velocity (VGA) moved to the orbit tab.
            - log g and [M/H] added to the Basic tab.
            - Teff configuration added to Utilities tab. Probably it will
              eventually become its own window.
            - Small bugs in configuration naming routines have been fixed.
              PHOEBE_CONFIG global variable contains a config filename, so
              phoebe.config, although generic, may be easily changed from
              the phoebe_gui_accessories.c. This may be eventually used for
              branching.
            - DCI files have been enumerated. They now follow the same pre-
              scription as the LCI files. This laid foundations for undoing
              in PHOEBE.
            - Dummy readout variables exchanged for %* switch.
            - "Flux Files Directory" added to the configuration window. It
              will remain disabled until the official flux files' support.
              All callbacks are connected, though. Saving/opening works.
            - Log g and metallicity values in keyword files were up until
              now in LD interpolation windows. Now they are in Basic tab.
              Values within interpolation windows are attached to the ones
              in Basic tab, e.g. they change on changed event.
            - About window version label changed to generic form in glade
              file. This has no impact on PHOEBE, just looks cleaner.
2003-01-21: - Import from DCI and Export to DCI entries have been added to
              the main menu, signals connected, but no code was yet written.
            - Luminosities tab finally set right. I'm pretty sure that after
              the today's change this tab will hardly be modified in future.
              It looks so nice and I'm sooooo happy with it! Aren't you?
            - Binary star image implemented in Luminosities tab. Another
              plot device, starxpm, defined in SuperMongo's graphcap.local.
              README file updated accordingly. Callbacks have been connec-
              ted, but actual routines still have to be written properly.
              As default, there is a nice UV Leonis plot at phase 0.4.
            - Main PHOEBE window was initialized before icon pathnames were
              set, so it failed to load pixmaps if run from any other di-
              rectory than src. Fixed.
2003-01-17: - Function read_in_data_file_info moved to phoebe_allocations.c
              from callbacks.
            - There was another units' problem in RV sigma, when RVs were
              inputted in km/s. Sigma was in km/s and internal data in 100
              km/s. This must be improved when automatic rescaling will have
              been done.
            - HJD0 fitting didn't work properly because of spin button <-->
              entry conversion failure. Fixed.
            - When data files were removed, filter combo boxes didn't get
              updated. This caused PHOEBE to crash when the user selected
              the non-existent filter. Fixed.
2003-01-16: - System constraints have been fully implemented and tested.
            - Empty LD coefficient defaults changed from 1.0 to 0.5. It ma-
              kes more sense not to have a linear cosine proportion for an
              average star, 0.5 seems to be better.
            - A bug which prevented aliasing to work when both RV curves are
              simultaneously plotted has been fixed.
2003-01-14: - In experimental LC data absolute error (sigma) is now accepted
              as a weighting function. The transformation function takes
              this value and calculates 1/\sigma^2, then maps it on the
              weighting interval [0.1, 9.9]. These are internal weights.
            - RV luminosities info list deleted. Although there is support
              for RV HLAs and CLAs, I can't think of a single reason why it
              should be there. If you think of a reason, please let me know,
              I will support it again in an eye-blink.
            - Luminosities tab heavily rearranged. "Luminosities" name for
              HLA and CLA have been changed to "Level", since that is what
              they are, although of course still connected to luminosities.
              Opacity function has been introduced as a user-supplied para-
              meter which cannot be adjusted. It is wavelength-dependent
              and it accompanies third light in its info file. Some space
              is left spare in the tab for future additions, most probably
              3D picture of the binary system.
2003-01-13: - PHOEBE 0.14 released.
            - Chi2 plotting routines have been thoroughly cleaned. Plot to
              File now works. This change will reflect in the next PHOEBE
              version and the CVS.
2003-01-12: - A small typo "differencial" changed to "differential" in the
              fitting tab.
            - There was a remnant of an LC function callback that crashed
              PHOEBE if magnitude was selected as a dependent variable.
              It has now been deleted and the problem is fixed.
            - A typo in LC plotting window: Experimental LC curve changed
              to Experimental light curve.
            - Extensive work on PHOEBE tutorial has been done.
2003-01-11: - Quit warning added; when the user clicks on the exit button
              or activates the Exit menu from the menu bar, PHOEBE will no
              longer blindly exit, but will prompt the user again.
2003-01-08: - LC Plotting window completely rearranged; all wavelength-de-
              pendent widgets have been deleted and a generic look was im-
              posed. RV plotting window already follows this scheme.
            - CTRL+q accelerator added to RV plotting window.
            - Chi2 functions tidied.
            - LC plotting functions and RV plotting functions have been mo-
              dified to be fool-proof without the need of shading certain
              widgets. If the settings are unfeasible, PHOEBE now displays
              a message (a notice window) about the problem.
2003-01-07: - Chi2 values have been replaced by weighted and unweighted sig-
              mas (standard deviations) in plotting windows. This is more
              meaningful to estimate offsets than chi2-s. This was suggested
              by Tomaz Zwitter. The routines for chi2 calculation are still
              preserved in both weighted and unweighted form. One accesses
              them by calling calculate_chi2 function with different "type"
              switch.
            - RV plotting window frames slightly changed.
2003-01-04: - Experimental data points (aka input files) weren't transformed
              correctly from HJDs to phases if DPDT was different from 0.
              Since this isn't totally trivial, I have added an appendix ex-
              plaining this to the tutorial.
2003-01-03: - HAPPY NEW YEAR! PHOEBE 0.14 will be out within the next week!
            - DPDT and DPERDT input formats have been changed to entries
              rather than spin buttons because of the desired double preci-
              sion. This will soon be obsolete (with GTK+2.0), but as an old
              branch this will be used as a workaround.
            - DCO readout values changed from F format to D format because
              of higher accuracy. Accordingly, DC output has been changed
              from %lf to %G (the conversion automatically chooses between
              floating-point and exponential form).
            - Automatic resizing of the correlation matrix window has been
              implemented, although not really elegantly. This could be im-
              proved with some dedicated GTK functions.
2002-12-26: - Step size in DC routine for orbital inclination was wrong be-
              cause of the OB1 error. Fixed.
            - "Update Selected" button in the DC window erased, since it
              doesn't make any physical sense to update only some parameter
              values, for this would certainly reduce the fit quality. The
              list is also changed to the "Single" mode.
            - Correlation matrix inspection fully supported. There is a
              button in the DC window that accesses the correlation matrix
              of the fit. It has been thoroughly tested and only one small
              issue persists: window dimensioning. It should be automati-
              cally dimensioned according to the CList size, but only if
              that size doesn't exceed some maximum size. If it does, it
              should use a scrolled window. At this point scrolled window
              is used for all CList dimensions.
2002-12-19: - DCI files were until now created in phase-space, because the
              minimization is significantly faster. Now the user may choose
              between phase and HJD for independent variable. It is done
              through a toggle button in the Fitting tab.
2002-12-18: - Constraints for mode 3 (overcontact binaries that are not in
              thermal contact) have been added.
2002-12-16: - RV plotting window completely changed. It seams that the HLA,
              CLA, VGA, ... values there were completely useless (they were
              originally provided for synthetic values (these were all wa-
              velength dependent quantities) and now they are fixed to their
              default values. If one wants to experiment with synthetic-only
              solutions, one may use the dummy input file. Please beware
              that the widgets aren't yet fool-proof.
            - Support for simultaneous plot of both lightcurves added. It
              has been tested preliminarly and indeed there are some mi-
              nor glitches with zooming and chi2 calculation, which have
              to be fixed as soon as possible, but they only occur at very
              unusual circumstances (e.g. 10000x zoom etc).
2002-12-12: - VGA description in the main PHOEBE window changed to prevent
              definition ambiguities. VGA should be given in km/s, regard-
              less of the units in input files (100km/s input is supported
              only because of earlier WD input files compatibility and ho-
              pefully everyone uses km/s these days!).
            - "Adopted units" in RV plotting renamed to km/s. It just isn't
              obvious to me that anyone would like something different. The
              output is limited to km/s accordingly. Choices have been re-
              arranged slightly in the dependent RV combo box.
            - "Systemic vel." label in RV plotting window changed to CoM RV.
            - switches.VUNIT variable erased; internal RV units will now
              be cemented to 100km/s (for WD98, invisible to the user) and
              shortly the units will be dynamically calculated (by log-ging
              we will measure the dimension and tune the units accordingly).
            - VGA DC calculation is now properly matching I/O units.
2002-12-11: - When a keyword file was saved, the file lists weren't updated
              and thus the user didn't see the newly created files, although
              they existed. Fixed.
            - TODO list updated.
            - Error handling improved on keyword files saving. If a user
              clicked on Save when there was no output file given, PHOEBE
              crashed. Now it issues a warning that a problem has occured
              and lets the user supply the filename.
            - Two new source files created: phoebe_configuration.c and .h.
              They contain all configuration-related functions, which have
              previously resided in callbacks.
            - OK button in the configuration window was functionless, it
              just hid the window. Now it applies the currently selected
              settings to the running PHOEBE session. These settings last
              until restart of PHOEBE or until the subsequent change in
              configuration, as is supposed to do.
2002-12-10: - Further work on 3D chi2 implementation has been done. Now
              routines plot to the main PHOEBE window instead of a tempora-
              ry file. The axes are still missing, but everything else
              works.
            - Symmetric derivatives switch was off by default. This is not
              the usual case, so it is now changed to be on by default.
2002-12-03: - Effective filter wavelengths, when changed in the Data tab,
              weren't changed in the limb darkening interpolation routines.
              This caused some limb darkening coefficients (most crucially
              Tycho/Hipparcos series) to be interpolated wrongly. Fixed.
            - Another problem persisted in interpolation routines: if there
              were multiple data files in the same filter bandpass defined
              (thus #num appended to filter names) LD routines didn't reco-
              gnise these filters as supported ones. Fixed.
2002-12-02: - There was a bug in the DC fitting window: if the user had only
              RV data or only LC data, the Update All procedure crashed
              PHOEBE because it tried to update the plotting windows. Fixed.
            - Major work has been done to incorporate spots into PHOEBE.
              GUI has been completely implemented, global declarations up-
              dated, read_in functions modified, a couple of new counters
              introduced. Yet to be done: keyword files open/save options,
              array dimensioning for spot parameters, DC fitting incorpora-
              tion and extensive testing.
2002-11-29: - After a long pause in development due to different article
              writting, I came back. A minor but significant change: the
              magnitude LCs are now calculated from the total flux and the
              given MNORM value in the Data tab. This rendered the MZERO
              switch obsolete. All routines cleaned to reflect this change.
2002-10-09: - There was a bug in PCSV calculation: q instead of 1/q was used
              and the calculated value was wrong. Fixed.
            - Phase ranges for LC and RV plots are now saved to keyword fi-
              les as suggested by Tomaz Zwitter.
2002-10-02: - VGA adjustability switch should not be available if there are
              no RVs present, because DC ignores it and this gets messy in
              the fitting window. Fixed.
2002-10-01: - UV Leonis LC data files changed: individual weights are added
              to the 3rd column based on nightly sigmas. The keyword file
              has been changed accordingly and the tutorial has been modi-
              fied to reflect this change.
2002-09-30: - The upper limit for the lightcurve spin button was set to 15,
              which doesn't really make sense, because there is practically
              no limitation for that value. It is changed to 100. If some-
              body needs a larger value, please let me know.
2002-09-26: - Reddening option added to PHOEBE Tutorial.
2002-09-24: - Some widgets were named in a VERY outdated fashion. Fixed.
            - Under Construction pixmap initialization moved from .glade
              file to phoebe_gui_accessories.c. This is done to prevent
              path-related problems that occured when PHOEBE is started
              for the first time.
            - Due to momentary lapse of reason I haven't updated the CVS
              documentation in ages. Now the newest phoebe_tutorial ver-
              sion is available for download via CVS.
            - PHOEBE HomePage updated to contain links to the tutorial and
              Van Hamme LD Tables.
            - Chi2 Plot to File button was sensitive although the Calculate
              button wasn't. Fixed.
            - Reddening may now be removed from within PHOEBE. The switch is
              placed to the LC Data Window and may be naturally used only
              when the dependent variable is magnitude. The input quantities
              R (the correlation coefficient) and E (B-V) (the color excess)
              are saved to the keyword file. These parameters have also been
              added to the switches typedef. Reddening is now hopefully com-
              pletely supported.
2002-09-20: - LC Plotting window outlook changed a bit. The upper part has
              been shrunk and a new check button has been added: Plot Re-
              siduals.
            - Plot Residuals functions have been implemented. There is a
              problem with aliased interpolation, but nothing can be done
              until BBL routine from WD98 is called directly from PHOEBE.
              This manifests in some weird outliers at the edge of the plot.
              Otherwise residuals work; the calculation depends on the plot
              settings (independent vs. dependent variable), it is *not* ge-
              neric. However, it is difficult to estimate the "usefulness"
              of the HJD residuals because of heavy extrapolation; this is
              why only phases are supported as independent variables at the
              time.
            - Sensitivity of the THE parameter was accidentally on initial-
              ly. Fixed.
            - A menu item created to hold all filters. These will eventually
              be connected to their flux files. This way it is much easier
              to select a particular filter than it was by browsing through
              a combo box. The menu is attached to the test button in the
              Utilities tab for now.
2002-09-19: - Fitting QuickBar connected to all main switches and values. It
              is now completely usable.
            - Mass ratio description changed -> secondary over primary part
              deleted because it was confusing to connect it to appreciated
              definition (secondary is *always* smaller than the primary).
              This was suggested by Panos Niarcos.
            - THE keyword for X-Ray binaries has been added to constraints
              handler. The entry is now disabled for other models.
            - More work on PHOEBE Homepage has been done.
            - Top-level files WISDOM, CAVEATS and QUESTIONS have been dele-
              ted, because their contents were obsolete.
            - A nice "under construction" xpm icon added to Orbit tab. :)
              This is the beginning of introducing small icons to PHOEBE
              buttons. This will hopefully be even more pleasent for the
              everyday user.
            - A lot of CVS repository directory cleaning has been done: the
              documentation was completely separated from phoebe source di-
              rectory, icons and pixmaps have been distinguished (icons are
              only those pixmaps which (will) appear on buttons and pixmaps
              in general are empty LC/RV/Chi2 plots and logos), all contri-
              butive files have been removed from the CVS. The data under
              the CVS is only for UV Leonis (along with basic parameters)
              and V505 Per (without any keyword file).
            - PHOEBE-0.13 testing version released.
2002-09-18: - Top-level README file SETTING UP section extended to include
              instructions for adding PHOEBE-related devices to SuperMongo's
              graphcap.local. Thanks to Frederic Royer for reminding me!
2002-09-17: - PHOEBE Homepage has been created. It is not completely fini-
              shed yet, but it is already functional and at present it re-
              sides on http://www.fiz.uni-lj.si/~prsa/phoebe.
2002-09-15: - Returned from the Monte Rosa GAIA conference. I have met Mr
              Wilson, Mr Van Hamme and Mr Milone, basically the alpha and
              omega of the eclipsing binaries world!!!
            - Fixed an OB1 error because of which mass ratio couldn't be
              fitted. This bug was fixed with help by Walter Van Hamme.
2002-09-05: - Added "tinygif" plotting device; it is useful for creating
              small animated gifs. Its size is 256x128 pixels.
2002-09-04: - PHOEBE Scripter window created. A button added to a Fitting
              tab that initiates the scripter. Scripter routines remain to
              be written.
2002-09-03: - Function prototypes that set widgets' sensitivity based on a
              solution constraints implemented. Constraining works for de-
              tached binaries and overcontact binaries.
            - IPB switch now also influences the sensitivity of CLA-depen-
              dent widgets. This tells the user when to expect CLAs to be
              computed from temperature (widgets are off) and when to be
              adjusted by user (widgets are on).
            - RV readout handling fixed. It should now be immune to arbit-
              rary comments within an .lco file.
            - Comments in .lco files rerouted to screen as notice windows.
              There are currently 4 supported notices (critical lobe and
              critical potential) and only one ever encountered! :)
2002-09-02: - WD98 .lco file obviously has only *more or less* standard sha-
              pe! Thus in some cases WD inserts a comment in a file (e.g.
              that the secondary star overfills the critical Roche lobe),
              which alters all positions of parameters in a file. Therefore
              PHOEBE crashed when such an unexpected comment was encountered
              during the readout. The whole concept of reading in values had
              to be changed. It has been done for LCs and remains to be done
              for RVs.
2002-09-01: - Cousins R and I filters added to the filter list.
2002-08-30: - A remnant of older versions which limited LCs to 5 fixed; now
              the top limit is set to 15 (Wilson 1998).
            - Drastic changes made to the filter list. Descriptive lines
              introduced for each filter set (Johnson, Stroemgren, Hippar-
              cos, RV and GAIA). Some wavelengths were catastrophically
              wrong! Fixed. It might be worth considering expandable list
              of filters, such as a pop-up menu with submenues instead of
              a combo box.
            - Comments still interfered with RV plots. Fixed.
            - Zillion new stars added to the data directory; they won't be
              put under the CVS, though, because although great, these data
              files bring nothing new, they just add to the bandpass amount
              and will be available for optional download from the PHOEBE
              homepage.
2002-08-29: - Data aliasing completed for phases (both LCs and RVs). The
              aliasing switch in both plotting windows initially turned on
              (there is no obvious reason why the user wouldn't want to
              use aliasing).
            - "Update Selection" button in the DC window disabled, because
              this option won't be implemented for quite some time (at
              least until much more pressing issues remain).
            - A Fitting QuickBar window created. Users have expressed the
              wish that adjustment switches and steps be gathered in an
              auxilliary window for faster access (so one doesn't have to
              browse through main PHOEBE tabs). The "Show QuickBar" button
              has been added to DC window. Callbacks haven't yet been con-
              nected to the DC window, so the QuickBar isn't functional
              yet.
            - Commenting supported in input data files. If a line in a data
              file contains '#', that line will be *completely* disregar-
              ded, wherever '#' is placed within that line. This could be
              improved in future so that PHOEBE disregards only the remain-
              der of the line, but that would mean too much work right now.
2002-08-28: - Chi2 3D plot wasn't working with orbital eccentricity. Fixed.
            - Two decimal numbers in Chi2 3D plot limits wasn't enough. It
              has been increased to 3. It would be useful to add automatic
              ranging in future, but it is a long-term plan.
            - PERR0 description changed. PERR0 value follows a strange
              convention where PERR0 = 0 and PERR0 = pi means that the
              elipse is oriented along the semi-minor axis.
            - A new callback added to all Adjust switches which updates
              the contents of the fitting window if these switches are
              toggled.
            - A bug fixed where original temperature values changed the
              units from K to 10000K. Now they are always in K.
            - Allocation in DCO readout wasn't correct for curve dependent
              parameters. This crashed PHOEBE when more than one such pa-
              rameters was to be adjusted. Fixed.
            - HJD -> phase transformation was off by 1 if HDJ0 was larger
              than HJD. Fixed.
            - Aliasing function implemented. GUI still has to be updated.
2002-08-27: - A new typedef "PHOEBE_dco_record" created. It holds all DCO
              quantities. It is associated with the "read_in_dco_values"
              function.
            - PERR0 units are radians. The range of PERR0 was [0, 100] and
              was obviously completely wrong. It is now set to [0, 2\pi].
            - Chi2 info list created in DC window. It contains a sum of
              squares for each data curve including only individual weig-
              hts (supplied by the user). The list has been completely
              integrated into normal operation.
            - GAIA filter wavelengths (Munari 1998) added to filter list.
            - LC/RV plotting parameters' updating is enhanced. There is no
              need to re-click on the Data switch to reread their values.
            - Systemic velocity step reduced from 1 (initially meant only
              for km/s) to 0.01 (to conform with 100km/s too).
            - PHOEBE documentation directory phoebe/doc put under a sepa-
              rate CVS. This way the user doesn't have to download the
              documentation if he doesn't want to.
            - Van Hamme limb darkening tables (along with an auxilliary
              PHOEBE file) added to the CVS directory catalogs/ld. This
              way the user may, if he so desires, download the tables
              independently from PHOEBE.
            - Instructions for obtaining PHOEBE from the CVS added to the
              top-level README file.
2002-08-26: - After 20 days of brain-dead activities and outmost leisure I
              have returned from a wonderful Montenegrian Sun. I can't say
              I'm too happy about that but I did relax and now I hope that
              PHOEBE will grow even smoother!
            - A lot of useful comments recieved from TOmaz and Paola!
              Thanks, guys!
            - VGA entry added to PHOEBE_wl_dependent_parameters structure.
            - A bug fixed in RV window: the VGA value wasn't updated when
              experimental data was selected. It now works.
            - Proximity effect switch (ICOR) split to two switches, each
              for one RV curve (ICOR1 and ICOR2). GUI updated.
2002-08-06: - Velocity units haven't been used in RV plotting. Fixed.
            - VUNIT switch moved from the Switches tab to RV plotting win-
              dow.
            - LC Plotting window slightly rearranged. The flux factor and
              magnitude base widgets are overlapping and are shown based on
              the choice of the dependent variable. Grid and box buttons
              moved more to the left. Phase normalization switch moved from
              Switches tab to here.
            - Switches tab finally deleted.
            - Well, dear reader, I am happily signing off and going to the
              Montenegrian seaside! Bye bye!
2002-08-05: - Inclination fitting diverges if the starting value is 90. Thus
              this value has been changed to 80.
            - A bug introduced when NPPL switch was deleted that caused gar-
              bage to be entered to a DCI file. Fixed.
            - Chi2 calculation for RVs was accidentally left disabled. Now
              it is back on.
            - If only experimental data is selected in plotting windows,
              synthetic curve (LC or RV) was calculated redundantly. Fixed.
            - Zooming and moving the RV plot caused garbage to be written
              as data points number. Fixed.
            - A new typedef enum PHOEBE_plot_device added to phoebe_global.
              It is passed to all plotting routines as an indicator of the
              desired output.
            - Plot to File button in LC plotting window enabled. Plotting
              devices currently supported are x11 (the screen), encapsulated
              postscript (eps), X Windows Pixmap (xpm) and columned plain
              text (ascii).
            - Prototypes for RV Plot to File functions created, but not
              connected yet.
            - A few small glitches smoothened out and unified through all
              Plot to File related routines.
            - Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) and Portable Pixmap (.ppm)
              added to device list.
            - RV Plot to File fully supported. Prototype functions made for
              chi2 plot. The Plot to File button has been added to the fit-
              ting window and callbacks generated. Chi2 plotting routine
              first has to be rewritten to use SM library. Then and only
              then Plot to File may be enabled.
2002-08-04: - All DEL-XY delimeters changed to Step, because it seemed WD98
              notation didn't help anyone, it just brought more confusion.
            - Interest combo box finally deleted. Button box was extended to
              include "Plot LC" button, "Plot RV" button and "Fitting" but-
              ton. The "Run" button was deleted along with all attached
              callback functions.
            - A parameter table in plotting windows was updated even if syn-
              thetic lightcurve wasn't plotted. Fixed.
            - A typing error Modelling -> Modeling fixed in both plotting
              windows.
            - IPB switch had an old callback dangling which crashed PHOEBE
              when the switch was turned on. Fixed.
            - The weighting "Edit Entry" button was enabled by default,
              which caused a segfault when clicked when no records were pre-
              sent. Fixed.
            - The tutorial extended significantly.
2002-08-03: - Column number spin button in the Data tab was obsolete and was
              deleted. Tutorial updated to reflect this change.
            - NPPL number spin button in the Data tab was obsolete and was
              deleted. Tutorial updated to reflect this change.
            - Tutorial heavily modified; all sorts of updates and improve-
              ments.
2002-08-02: - A bug caused a fatal PHOEBE termination if assigned data file
              didn't have any filters assigned. This was a consequence of
              non-consistent filter names checking for plotting routines.
              This bug is now fixed.
            - Another bug that changed multiple filter names has been fixed:
              if a data entry has been edited, but its filter remained un-
              changed, then an extra #2 was appended to its name. Fixed.
            - Fool-proofing added to data file format; if the format doesn't
              conform to the format defined in Data tab, experimental data
              output is suppressed.
            - Fool-proofing added to missing filenames; again, if a file-
              name is missing (invalid), PHOEBE warns the user about it
              and suppresses any further data output.
            - Corrected parameter values from fitting are now updated in
              plotting windows as well. This eliminates the work-around
              of turning off and then on the data switch in those windows.
            - A bug that resetted original values when clicked on Update
              button in the DC Corrections window, although there were
              no corrections calculated, fixed. Now nothing happens.
            - phoebe/data directory updated.
2002-08-01: - PHOEBE 0.12 released. This is the first testing version.
            - First 18 pages of PHOEBE 0.12 tutorial have been written.
2002-07-31: - Binning checked, some minor type inconsistencies fixed.
            - Code cleaning even furtherly purified PHOEBE.
            - Synthetic grid buttons have been temporarily disabled, be-
              cause of their unfinished state. They will be made available
              in the next version (or the CVS shortly).
2002-07-30: - After a long long time, RVs are working again without any ma-
              jor issues. Plotting of *both* RVs at the same time is cur-
              rently disabled, because it is very dangerous to examine both
              curves at the same time -> users don't bother to check if
              the right data belongs to the right synthetic RV curve. This
              decision will be given more thought soon.
            - A bug in filter naming (adding a #number to multiple curves
              in same filters), which added extra #number if already num-
              bered filter's record (other than the filter itself) was
              changed, is now fixed.
            - Level-dependent weighting (NOISE) added to wl_dependent type-
              def and is read in properly.
            - Fitting functions GREATLY simplified and working wonderfully.
            - Mass ratio (RM) spin-button steps were too large. Fixed.
            - An ambiguity in units of RVs fixed; fitting now *always* uses
              100km/s as units, so PHOEBE takes care of the transformation
              from km/s if necessary. That was the reason why the fitting
              of semi-major axis failed; now it works without issues. How-
              ever, mass ratio is still returning nan after fitting.
            - A FIRST EVER preliminary result reached with PHOEBE: UV Leo.
              The configuration file may be found in the data directory.
2002-07-29: - A bug in RV dependent variable keyword entries fixed.
            - A LOT of work rearranging routines has been done.
2002-07-26: - phoebe_global.h created. It will hold all global variables and
              typedefs from now on.
            - phoebe_allocations.c and phoebe_allocations.h created. All
              memory allocations, readouts, struct readins etc. go in here.
            - All global declarations moved from main.h to phoebe_global.h
              and main.h erased, Makefile.am updated.
            - phoebe_gui_typedefs.c and phoebe_gui_typedefs.h erased.
            - Memory allocation for PHOEBE_data_record types moved to
              phoebe_allocations.c. Callbacks code cleaned with this.
            - Default dependent variable in LC plot window changed from
              Magnitude to Total Flux.
            - A humongous fixing has begun; all functions now go through a
              major rework and hopefully, everything after this fix will
              be ready for the first ever major public release.
2002-07-25: - FOUND THE BUG! Again, readout_str vs. working_str violation.
            - open_keyword_file () function simplified with another readout
              function. Implementation is finished, keywords still have to
              be adopted.
            - Secondary star temperature (TAVC) had wrong units in DC fit-
              ting window. Fixed.
            - DC Update All Corrections button functional. It works for
              both plain widgets and CLists.
            - LD interpolation window got hidden when values were updated.
              This wasn't practical. The window now closes only on the
              click to the Close button.
            - Started working on SuperMongo library calls instead of ex-
              ternal calls to SuperMongo itself. Library bindings work,
              but we just lost on general portability. Autoutils should
              check if these libs are available and if not, compile it
              without SM support. If nothing else, ./configure must fail
              if these libraries are missing.
2002-07-24: - Seeking a bug that crashes PHOEBE while opening keyword file
              on some machines (not including mine), but to no avail. Some
              small irrelevant details changed in affected routines.
2002-07-23: - A nonsense layout of X2A adjustability widget in LD tab fixed.
            - Marquardt lambda (XLAMDA) widget added. A switches typedef
              has been extended to include it, also read_in_switches ()
              function reads it in as well. DCI creation routine has been
              updated accordingly.
            - Fitting parameters layout in Fitting tab changed.
            - All "Adjustable" switches renamed to "Adjust" for obvious
              reasons. Widget names have also been changed from _adjustable
              to _adjust.
            - Model combo box contents changed to be more user-friendly.
            - A warning window, although created, didn't show up on the
              screen in some circumstances. Fixed.
2002-07-22: - Chi2 calculation button was not fool-proof against undefined
              filter, which caused PHOEBE to crash. Fixed.
            - main.c cleared; it now contains only init functions.
            - An overflow bug in version number string fixed.
            - MODE combo box moved from Switches to Data tab. Also, Name
              entry for star name has been created. It has no significant
              purpose other than easier paperwork.
            - N1 and N2 separated and moved from Switches tab to Fitting
              tab. Same has been done for N1L and N2L.
            - ISYM switch (symetrical derivatives) moved to Fitting tab.
            - Fool-proofing added to environment readout; PHOEBE scans the
              environment to find the HOME entry. If it fails, it prompts
              the user to define it and restart PHOEBE. $HOME is definitely
              a must-have on Linux, so this doesn't seem too harsh.
2002-07-19: - Some minor glitches of already existent CLists fixed.
            - Limb Darkening Coefficients for RVs CListed.
            - Level-dependent weighting CListed. This is the last LC/RV num-
              ber dependent quantity, so hopefully we're through with chan-
              ging the interface. Now routines will be optimized for as
              many LCs and RVs as the user wants (actually, the current LC
              limitation posed by WD98 is 25) and soon a new release will be
              made.
            - Finally, the doubling, tripling, ... of LC and/or RV curve
              filters is handled correctly. To each filter name there is a
              #number appended to separate one curve from another. It is
              done in only one routine, which changes PHOEBE_*_data accor-
              dingly. This means that all other functions that depend on
              filters *must* read only PHOEBE_*_data[i].filter names.
            - LD interpolation routine fixed to reflect the above change.
2002-07-18: - 3rd light CListed.
            - LC plotting turned off because of extensive changes in main
              PHOEBE window.
            - SPECS file enhanced with What Goes Where section and Widgets
              Naming Convention section.
            - phoebe_init () function created to lighten the load of main().
            - Further code cleaning has been done.
						- Limb Darkening Coefficients CListed. Interpolation routines
              fixed accordingly.
2002-07-17: - RV lists incorporated onto their designated places in Data and
              Luminosities tabs. RV plotting is still turned off at the mo-
              ment and will remain so until integration is complete.
            - Keyword entries precision changed from single to double.
            - Serious code cleaning done.
            - Defaults main button activated.
2002-07-16: - A small bug fixed: PHOEBE segfaulted when double-clicked on
              the empty CList record. Checking is now incorporated every-
              where.
2002-07-15: - Theory of fields PASSED!!! :)
2002-07-09: - Zero magnitude spin button added to Data tab. This is not to
              be confused with MZERO value of WD98. This is a value of mag-
              nitudes which is used to transform magnitude-given input fi-
              les to fluxes. One should set this value (from now on reffer-
              red to as MNORM) to have the flux in quarter phase after
              transformation around unity and then adjust luminosities to
              fit the exact values of normalization.
            - Synthetic grid changed: previously it was arranged filter
              after filter, which isn't really practical for reading out
              the values. This is why it has been changed to sort the grid
              by filters last, meaning different filters for same parameter
              values are together.
2002-07-08: - LC luminosities have been CListed and placed from Utilities
              to Luminosities tab. Same has to be done for RVs.
2002-07-05: - After much effort, CList for LC information has finally re-
              placed all obsolete widgets. Same has to be done for RVs.
            - Luminosities CList containers for both LCs and RVs created.
              Both CLists now reside in Utilities tab and will be moved
              to Luminosities as soon as possible.
2002-07-04: - A few fixes on observational weighting have been done.
            - Added new UV Leonis photometric data.
2002-07-03: - An upper limit for LC number set to 25, according to (Wilson
              2001, WD98, pg. 17).
            - Created a toplevel WISDOM file, which contains physical in-
              sights to PHOEBE related modeling.
            - Normalization routine estimate_zero_magnitude added to trans-
              formations. It is based on unweighted average, which is not
              the best possible choice (median would be better). However,
              input fluxes to DC are in arbitrary units (they *must* be
              fluxes and not magnitudes, though), so normalization isn't
              really important. It is the question of style, really; it is
              nice to at least tend to normalize magnitude-supplied data
              to unity at quarter phase. This remains in the TODO.
            - All normalization procedures from magnitude-based input files
              now go over estimate_zero_magnitude function. MZERO influen-
              ces *only* the LC magnitude output. FACTORed LC output is
              unnecessary and will probably dissapear soon.
            - Luminosities and limb darkening coefficients all have as many
              values as there are lightcurves. Therefore DC info list must
              contain as many entries. Done.
2002-07-02: - phoebe_warning function added to improve error handling.
            - More work on DC calculation window integration has been done.
            - Further file-list integration has been done. Old widgets are
              slowly being deleted.
            - Luminosity spin button limitations fixed; the upper limit was
              4\pi, now it's 100.
            - If there are no RV curves present, WD98 cannot calculate SMA,
              so the adjustment button has to be disabled. Fixed.
            - Temperature adjusting has to have changed units. Fixed.
            - Memory initialization bug that caused DC computation to crash
              when run without and RV curves fixed.
            - String allocation bug in LD typedef fixed.
            - Fixed a bug in DCI creation function that used the wrong va-
              lue for YBOL1.
2002-07-01: - DC calculation window created. It contains a list of all pa-
              rameters selected for adjustment with their original values.
              After the calculation all other cells are filled with read
              data from DCO file.
2002-06-30: - Added double-clicking editability of synthetic grid entries.
              Unfortunately, this demanded that the list widget remains
              active all the time, because disabling it during the editing
              also disables "event" signal propagation. The sensitivity is
              therefore kept on all the time.
            - Added double-clicking editability of lightcurve data. The
              same restrictions apply as above.
            - 2D correlations Calculate button sensitivity fixed. If clic-
              ked on that button when no lightcurves were defined, the
              program crashed. It is now fixed.
            - A DC minimization window created and adjusting parameter list
              populated. Calculation functions are already finished, all we
              yet have to do is to add individual experimental curves' sig-
              mas and write the calculated values into the list.
2002-06-28: - PHOEBE version number and date is now declared in main.c and
              main.h. Up until now the label in GLADE file had to be chan-
              ged and the whole package recompiled.
            - A small header created for grid files.
            - Grid-related source files phoebe_grid.c and phoebe_grid.h
              introduced and all relevant functions and callbacks moved
              there.
2002-06-25: - Keyword file saving/opening now works for both old and new
              LC declaration widgets. Old parts have been marked for dele-
              tion.
            - RV columned list has been added to Utilities window. Every-
              thing is the same as for LC columned list, it just needs to
              to be finished. The question is, of course, what is the mea-
              ning of more than 2 RV curves.
            - Synthetic grid calculator didn't refresh the list on conse-
              cutive button-clicks. Fixed.
            - Editing synthetic LC grid parameters is now possible; there
              is a special window dedicated to that.
            - Finally, grid calculation is about finished. Everything else
              (including defining different grid parameters) will be done
              in one of next releases.
2002-06-24: - Dialog windows have been destroyed if one would close them by
              pressing the (x) button on the window decoration. This beha-
              vior was wrong; the window should only be hidden. Fixed.
            - The effort to bring more LCs to PHOEBE has paid off during the
              past few days; with a lot of testing and learning, PHOEBE is
              finally capable of handling infinite light~ and radial velo-
              city curves. Currently there is a columned list in Utilities
              tab and it will remain so until everything works without any
              issues. Keyword file saving has been modified already to re-
              flect this change.
            - Unfortunately, explained development has pushed the date of
              0.12 release for another few weeks. I hope it was worth wai-
              ting for.
2002-06-17: - Grid calculation added to Utilities tab. Window is created and
              templates have been set. Basic calculation is already availa-
              ble.
2002-06-14: - All variable names have been cleaned up for 0.12 release.
2002-06-09: - PHOEBE UNDER CVS :pserver:andrej@deneb.ago.uni-lj.si:[path]!
            - Chi2 plotting function cleaned of directory dependency; now
              all calculations are performed in PHOEBE_TEMP_DIR.
2002-06-06: - Extensive code cleaning performed.
            - DEVELOPERS text file renamed to SPECS, since it contains spe-
              cifications and suggestions for potential developers.
            - The worst bug ever discovered in PHOEBE: a humongous memory
              leak was produced by allocating, printing to and freeing
              string pointers generated by GTK. This is prohibited by GTK
              and that was the cause of earlier crashes (prior to multi-
              ple strings work-around). It is now mainly fixed (in all ma
              jor .c sources) and it will be thoroughly checked before the
              next release.
2002-06-05: - Wavelength-dependent typedef is extended to read out RV data
              next to already implemented LC readout. This drastically sim-
              plifies RV plotting routines.
2002-06-03: - An aspectxpm entry added to SuperMongo's graphcap.local. It
              will eventually make aspectgif obsolete, which is done because
              of GIF copyright problems.
            - A small bug that prevented 3D Chi2 initial (empty) plot to
              have a proper dimension has been fixed.
            - All image formats changed to XPM instead of GIF.
            - A new spin button has been put to PHOEBE_plot_lc window:
              standard deviation. It is easier to "measure" how good the
              experimental estimate for sigma is.
            - A complete style unification has been started. At this point
              no new features will be added until the code is cleaned com-
              pletely.
            - Clean-up functionality added; prior to exiting, PHOEBE now
              deletes all the files it created in PHOEBE_TEMP_DIR directo-
              ry -> all phoebe_* files.
2002-06-02: - A small bug in file_exists function fixed; it returned errno
              handler, which is volatile and thus not appropriate for re-
              turns. The switch is now boolean and we use it like boolean:
              if (file_exists ("bla")) or if (! file_exists ("bla")). All
              functions have been updated accordingly (hopefully ;) ).
            - Finally, believe it or not, A MAJOR FIX: the consecutive fi-
              lenames for all config/run files have been numbered and no-
              thing is lost anymore! The fine-tuning will be done as soon
              as gif->xpm conversion is finished. 
2002-05-30: - Error handling for malloc, realloc and fatal events implemen-
              ted. Memory access is now called through those wrappers; this
              is not a sound policy, but for as long as memory testing goes,
              this seems to be best.
            - Chi2 2D correlation works! Well, kind of; parameters' limits
              still have to be taken from their spin buttons, a bunch of
              non-important, stylistic buttons have to be finished, but
              already a user can calculate and draw SMA vs. XINCL!
2002-05-29: - An ugly bug fixed: when calculating chi2, the values further-
              most to the right were treated as they were on the left due
              to inaccurate inequality. It is now fixed.
2002-05-27: - Independent variable switch deleted. It seems that that combo
              has no purpose, since independent variable is set from the LC
              Plotting window. The entry has also been deleted from keyword
              files.
            - Spin buttons FACTOR and MZERO were moved to LC Plotting win-
              dow. It just makes more sense for them to be there.
            - Third light and opacity support finished in LC Plotting.
            - RV Plotting Window rearranged to reflect the changes in LC
              Plotting window. It would be worth considering what are the
              benefits of separate plotting window; is it really necessary?
              Wouldn't it be more intuitive to have them integrated in the
              main PHOEBE window?
            - VGA spin button added to RV Plotting window. It seems like a
              useful variable in the plotting window itself.
            - Most of RV plotting routines have been enhanced and modified
              so to follow the example from LC plotting.
2002-05-24: - Synthetic noise support has been finished; the button has been
              moved to Luminosities tab (for correspondence with weighting)
              and keyword files hold the information on the switch state and
              the seed value. A random number generator for seed has been
              made.
            - Standard deviation for synthetic noise background label and
              spin button have been added; now hopefully synthetic noise
              makes sense.
            - Detailed reflection effect transferred to luminosities tab as
              well; keywords and read_in functions have been updated to
              reflect that change.
            - 3rd light support finished: initial values changed from 10.0
              to 0.0; wl_dependent read_in function extended to contain 3rd
              light as well.
            - Plot LC window rearranged to contain 3rd light and Opacity
              function spin buttons. They are supported formally, but fil-
              ter-dependent callbacks still have to be adjusted.
2002-05-23: - A small inconsistency fixed in callback functions: the PHSV/
              PCSV calculation routines used the separate function for
              shading regulation, which already exists generically.
            - RM and F1 values from main PHOEBE window are now transferred
              to PHSV/PCSV calculation window prior to calculation.
            - Status bar now informs the user that PHSV/PCSV calculation
              has been initiated.
            - A small bug fixed: if LC number was changed, the change didn't
              reflect in fitting and plotting combo boxes. Now it does.
2002-05-22: - Added filename parameter in create_dci_file routine. This
              eliminated the "no write privilidges" warning.
            - Deleted obsolete function variables for LCI file creation:
              IFSMV1, IFSMV2, PHNORM, THE, VUNIT, FACTOR, MZERO. They have
              already been included through typedefs. A new typedef has
              been introduced for wavelength dependent parameters.
            - Extensive code cleaning has been made around LC plotting.
            - Another nasty bug has been eliminated; due to rounding error
              in WD98 the number of synthetic points doesn't always corres-
              pond to chosen number; thus renumbering was necessary and
              now it has been done so.
            - A Chi2 plotting function has been further implemented; it
              now has a nice progress bar to ease your waiting. Also, the
              implementation triggered a heavy code change; it is now even
              more mature and I hope it now has more or less standard form.
2002-05-21: - Default setting for semi-major axis changed from 1 to 10.
            - A nasty bug fixed that caused segfault in LC plot: if binning
              was active and independent variable was set to time and expe-
              rimental data was turned on, the plot segfaulted due to bin-
              ning attempt.
2002-05-20: - Started working on DC section; a two-parameter correlation GUI
              has been created in the Fitting tab, a routine for dcout read-
              out has been prototyped.
2002-05-17: - Higher Quantum Mechanics PASSED!!! :)
2002-05-07: - LD interpolation button was active even if the LD switch in
              configuration window was off. It is now fixed.
            - MMS support finished. It is to be considered if it is impor-
              tant to save MMS settings to keyword file. Currently it seems
              unnecessary.
2002-05-06: - Preliminary support for the method of multiple subsets has
              been introduced to Fitting tab. Clicks and shades appear to
              work correctly; the DCI creation still doesn't reflect the
              implementation.
2002-05-05: - About PHOEBE window created and connected to Help menu entry.
2002-04-28: - Digits after a decimal place have been changed for temperature
              from 5 to 0, since it makes no sense to have temperatures to
              5 decimals accurate.
            - Monochromatic/bolometric buttons have been joint to only one
              interpolation button; the choice is now reflected in the se-
              parate interpolation window through a combo box.
            - All interpolation callbacks have been finished. Interpolation
              now works for bolometric and monochromatic values.
            - Log g and metallicity values added to keyword files.
200204-27: - LD tables readout has been changed; return value is now a
              typedefed PHOEBE_data, where .weight is used to carry error
              handler and .indep and .dep return values for x and y. The
              routine for bolometric readout is no longer necessary, for
              the new routine has been introduced that reads out data based
              on the desired filter, supplied as an argument.
            - Fixed a rounding bug in metallicity string conversion.
            - A file ld_availability.data has been created and put to LD
              shared directory; it contains triplets (T, log g, M) that
              are available in LD tables and is used for interpolation.
            - Interpolation routine has been completed and tested. There
              are potential flaws in out-of-range values, but for now just
              avoid them; it will be fixed with global error-handling.
            - Temperature spin-button limits have been changed accordingly:
              from 2000-20000 to 3500-50000 interval of allowed values.
            - A new GUI window for interpolation has been created, but only
              the GUI layout. Callbacks still have to be connected.
2002-04-21: - Error handling for LD table readout is provided through an
              integer return value: 0 for OK and -1 for failure.
2002-04-05: - Started working on limb darkening coefficients interpolation.
              Configuration window has been modified to contain LD switch
              and directory entry. Two new source files have been introdu-
              ced: phoebe_limb_darkening.c and phoebe_limb_darkening.h.
							A prototype for the interpolating function has been created.
2002-03-22: - Transformation routines have been enhanced - they now use
              typedefs instead of static variables. There was also a problem
              with FACTORing, which is now fixed.
            - All climb rates for spin buttons have been unified and set
              to zero. Values change much more smoothly now.
            - Normalization routine has been implemented for correct nor-
              malization. Up until now the "normalization" only multiplied
              the input data by FACTOR, now it actually normalizes data
              at PHNORM and then multiplies it by FACTOR. Possible problems
              exist if there are no data points close to PHNORM.
2002-03-20: - Spin-button step for XINCL changed from 0.01 to 0.1.
            - IPB and IFAT* switches have been moved to Luminosities tab.
              IPB influences whether CLAs are to be taken into account, so
              it makes more sense to have it there. Shading for CLAs has
              been fixed to reflect this switch. IFAT2 switch never existed
              and now it does.
2002-03-17: - Prototypes for fitting functions have been made.
            - A bug in DCI file creation has been fixed: due to cfortran.h
              "feature" that images C's [0,n] to FORTRAN's [1,n+1] auto-
              matically produced an OB1 error in PHOEBE code. Now it has
              been fixed and tested.
            - Due to ANSI C compatibility all GTK+ related typedefs (gint,
              gchar, ...) have been replaced by original C declarations.
              As PHOEBE progresses, it would be much better to check the
              float/double/.../ dependent accuracy from a Makefile.am and
              not by GTK+ typedefs.
            - A bug in RV plot due to inconsistency between data VUNIT and
              synthetic VUNIT has been fixed. It now works for arbitrary
              synthetic VUNIT values.
2002-03-14: - LC Binning finally fully supported. Any sense in binning RVs?
            - A serious code-cleaning has been made concerning static and
              dynamic space allocation. Hopefully everything will work
              much better now that RAM is dinamically accessed.
2002-03-11: - A bug fixed that wrote PHNORM value as integer instead of
              double into a keyword file.
2002-03-10: - Switches tab changed; it is eventually expected that this tab
              will dissapear and its entries distributed to other tabs.
2002-03-08: - Fixed-size arrays changed to dynamically allocated memory
              blocks. The source hasn't been tested for leaks yet; the main
              reason for this is to allow PHOEBE to receive as large input
              data block as limited by RAM itself. Practically this means
              that all limitations are set by the WD98, not by PHOEBE.
2002-03-05: - Weighting supported in Luminosities tab. Now you may choose
              between three different weighting options.
2002-03-04: - Adjustable toggle buttons for LD coefficients have been
              fixed: it is not bolometric values that can be adjusted,
              but monochromatic ones.
2002-0228: - PHOEBE-0.11 pre-release version released.
            - GUI has been changed even further: "Exotic" tab was renamed
              to "Orbit", since it contains orbital parameters. Some space
              is reserved for Roche lobe graph and slice diagrams. A new
              tab has been created, "Luminosities", where all HLA and CLA
              variables are put. Third light (EL3) support has been added.
              The order of tabs has been changed to more meaningful order.
2002-02-26: - RV plotting was accidentally turned off in PHOEBE-0.10. It is
   hanged to more meaningful order.
