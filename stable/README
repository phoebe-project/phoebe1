PHOEBE-0.24 TOPLEVEL DOCUMENTATION                              MAY 3rd, 2004
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello and thank you for your interest in PHOEBE.

THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW
-----------------------

PHOEBE is currently in its testing phase, which means that you may download
PHOEBE freely, but you are kindly asked to let the author know of you using
this software. You may freely share PHOEBE with others as long as no changes
are imposed on the code. For further information please read the GNU/GPL li-
cence in PHOEBE documentation. If you do feel you need to change the code,
be sure to distribute it only if the original version along with exact chan-
ging policy is attached.

Wilson-Devinney WD2003 code is distributed along with this version of PHOEBE
for testing purposes only. If you are new to WD2003, please contact Robert E.
Wilson, University of Florida, and let him know that you use his software.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

To successfully set up PHOEBE, you need:

- A Linux machine:

  PHOEBE has been successfully tested on the following platforms:

    * Debian Woody 3.0r1   no issues
    * Debian Woody 3.0r2   no issues
    * Debian Sarge         no issues    (development platform)
    * Linux Redhat 7.2     no issues
    * Linux Redhat 7.3     no issues
    * Linux Redhat 8.0     no issues
    * Linux Redhat 9.0     no issues
    * Linux Fedora Core 1  no issues
    * Linux Fedora Core 2  no issues
    * Linux SUSE 8.2       no issues
    * Linux SUSE 9.0       no issues
    * Gentoo Linux 2004    no issues

  If you ran PHOEBE successfully on a different platform, please inform the
  author.

- autoconf and automake suite for generic compiling (comes with every single
  brand of Linux we're aware of and is installed by default).

- ANSI C compliant compiler (gcc will do just fine),

- FORTRAN F77 compliant compiler (g77 will do just fine),

- Plotting package GnuPlot and/or SuperMongo:

  For plotting, PHOEBE uses external programs. Currently, two such plotting
  programs are supported: GnuPlot (the default) and SuperMongo (deprecated).
  Until version 0.23 SuperMongo was the only supported package, but since
  it is commercial, it doesn't suit PHOEBE licence, which is GPL. Usage of
  GnuPlot is thus highly encouraged. GnuPlot functions are implemented by
  Michael Bauer.

  If you are set on using SuperMongo, please note that it *must* be installed
  completely, along with libraries and header files. These usually reside in
  /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include:

    Header files:              Libraries:
      copyright.h                libdevices.a
      options.h                  libplotsub.a
      sm_declare.h               libutils.a

  If you don't have them, please ask your local administrator to install them
  for you. Usually you get along by compiling SM in ordinary fashion (there is
  no need to install a callable parser) and copying header files to your inclu-
  de directory (usually /usr/local/include).

  Finally, a word of caution: if you compiled SuperMongo with default numerical
  type float instead of double, PHOEBE compilation will report pointer incompa-
  tibility warnings. This shouldn't prevent PHOEBE from working properly, but
  strange issues have been reported with using float type and older SuperMongo
  versions. So, to prevent SM issues, it is strongly encouraged to recompile it
  with default numerical type double instead of float.

- GTK+1.2 or higher graphical library. This is a standard component to
  virtually all Linuxes of today.

OPTIONAL
--------

- Van Hamme limb darkening tables may now be obtained from the PHOEBE CVS
  and later put to PHOEBE shared directory. You may set it up in 
  Settings->Configuration window.

OBTAINING PHOEBE
----------------

PHOEBE may be obtained by two common ways:

1. By downloading the stable release from PHOEBE homepage:

     http://www.fiz.uni-lj.si/phoebe

   This method is preferable for casual users. I will do my best to support
   your work with stable releases.

2. By checking out the daily version from anonymous CVS:

   Login:

     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@deneb.ago.uni-lj.si:/var/lib/cvs login

   [ hit <ENTER> for password ]

   The main program:

     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@deneb.ago.uni-lj.si:/var/lib/cvs \
                                                              checkout phoebe

   The bleeding-edge development version:

     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@deneb.ago.uni-lj.si:/var/lib/cvs \
                                                          checkout phoebe-dev

   Documentation (optional):

     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@deneb.ago.uni-lj.si:/var/lib/cvs \
                                                       checkout documentation

   Van Hamme limb darkening tables (optional):

     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@deneb.ago.uni-lj.si:/var/lib/cvs \
                                                         checkout catalogs/ld

   This method is preferable for testing users and contributors. Please note
   that the development version might not work, it might not even compile.
   If you want the latest updates that are considered for the stable
   distribution, use the main program rather than the bleeding edge.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install by following generic instructions in INSTALL; to make a long story
short, this will work on all above mentioned platforms:

	./configure
	make
	su
	make install

If the compilation fails with the following error:

  ../autoconfig/depcomp: ../autoconfig/depcomp: No such file or directory
  make[2]: *** [main.o] Error 127

this means that you have newer autoutils suite. Please run:

  autoreconf --force --install

and then repeat the generic installation steps given above.

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR PRE-PHOEBE-0.24 USERS
------------------------------------------

SuperMongo plotting package is replaced by GNUPlot, which is now the default
plotting package. Please consider switching to GNUPlot, since due to licence
problems SuperMongo support might be discontinued in future PHOEBE versions.

Due to future expansion possibility with other numerical models, 'wd98/' and
'wd2003/' directories have been renamed to 'wd/'. Please fix the paths in
your configuration file to accord to this change.

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR PRE-PHOEBE-0.22 USERS
------------------------------------------

The change of keyword file logic in 0.20 and 0.21 introduced a bug that arbi-
trarily lacked parts of strings in keyword files. This was due to GTK+ readout
inconsistency and is now fixed. Please update your keyword files!

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR PRE-PHOEBE-0.20 USERS
------------------------------------------

If you are upgrading PHOEBE, please note that the keywords file format has
changed. This was done to conform to ISO BASH standards of keyword assignment.
This way the scripter may be called with much simpler keyword files. See the
User Manual for details.

When you open an old PHOEBE keyword file, a notice window will be displayed,
telling you that you are opening a legacy PHOEBE keyword file. The only thing
you should do to convert it to the new format is to save it (simply rewriting
will do) in the new PHOEBE version.

SETTING UP
----------

- If you want to use SuperMongo, you should add appropriate devices to the
  Super Mongo plotting package device file. This file usually resides in:

    /usr/local/lib/sm/graphcap.local

  These lines don't get appended automatically, because there are many diffe-
  rent policies regarding proprietary software, which SM definitely is; thus
  you should manually add the following lines to that file:

    aspectgif|aspectGIF|GIF via PPM (using ppmtogif), 512x256:\
      :DV=raster:xr#512:yr#256:CL:\
      :EP=\001:OW=P6 512 256 255\n:\
      :SY=${BIN}/rasterise -r $0 $F - | ppmtogif > $1:\
      :tc=ppm:

    tinygif|tinyGIF|GIF via PPM (using ppmtogif), 256x192:\
      :DV=raster:xr#256:yr#192:CL:\
      :EP=\001:OW=P6 256 192 255\n:\
      :SY=${BIN}/rasterise -r $0 $F - | ppmtogif > $1:\
      :tc=ppm:

    aspectxpm|aspectXPM|XPM via PPM (using ppmtoxpm), 512x256:\
      :DV=raster:xr#512:yr#256:CL:\
      :EP=\001:OW=P6 512 256 255\n:\
      :SY=${BIN}/rasterise -r $0 $F - | ppmtoxpm > $1:\
      :tc=ppm:

    tinyxpm|tinyXPM|XPM via PPM (using ppmtoxpm), 256x192:\
      :DV=raster:xr#256:yr#192:CL:\
      :EP=\001:OW=P6 256 192 255\n:\
      :SY=${BIN}/rasterise -r $0 $F - | ppmtoxpm > $1:\
      :tc=ppm:

    starxpm|starXPM|XPM via PPM (using ppmtoxpm), 320x192:\
      :DV=raster:xr#320:yr#192:CL:\
      :EP=\001:OW=P6 320 192 255\n:\
      :SY=${BIN}/rasterise -r $0 $F - | ppmtoxpm > $1:\
      :tc=ppm:

  Maybe some day there will be a script within Makefile.am that will automate
  this process, but it is a long term plan. (Want to contribute?)

- When you first start PHOEBE, a configuration window appears. You may access
  that window at any time by chosing Settings->Configuration menu. You have to
  supply PHOEBE with information on where to find or expect certain files. De-
  fault settings are usually OK for system-wide installation (most common and
  preferable way), just be sure to have write permissions to the temporary di-
  rectory and to the data directory. If you are installing PHOEBE just for a
  single user, you might set up your directories like this:

    *** For single-user access only ***

    Base Directory:        /home/[your_name]/phoebe
    Source Directory:      /home/[your_name]/phoebe/src
    Share Directory:       /home/[your_name]/phoebe/share
    Working Directory:     /tmp
    Data Directory:        /home/[your_name]/phoebe/data
    WD LC Directory:       /home/[your_name]/phoebe/bin
    WD DC Directory:       /home/[your_name]/phoebe/bin

- You may edit PHOEBE configuration files and keyword files by hand. Keywords
  are not order-sensible, which means that there is no specific or even pre-
  ferable order of appearence. If you enter an invalid keyword, it will simply
  be ignored. Whitespaces and tabs are arbitrary too.
